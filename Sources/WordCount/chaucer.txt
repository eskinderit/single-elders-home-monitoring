When the sweet showers of April have pierced The drought of March, and pierced it to the root, And every vein is bathed in that moisture Whose quickening force will engender the flower And when the west wind too with its sweet breath Has given life in every wood and field To tender shoots, and when the stripling sun Has run his half-course in Aries, the Ram, And when small birds are making melodies, That sleep all the night long with open eyes, (Nature so prompts them, and encourages); Then people long to go on pilgrimages, And palmers * to take ship for foreign shores, And distant shrines, famous in different lands; And most especially, from all the shires Of England, to Canterbury they come, The holy blessed martyr * there to seek, Who gave his help to them when they were sick. It happened at this season, that one day In Southwark at the Tabard * where I stayed Ready to set out on my pilgrimage To Canterbury, and pay devout homage, There came at nightfall to the hostelry Some nine-and-twenty in a company, Folk of all kinds, met in accidental Companionship, for they were pilgrims all; It was to Canterbury that they rode. The bedrooms and the stables were good-sized, The comforts offered us were of the best. And by the time the sun had gone to rest I’d talked with everyone, and soon became One of their company, and promised them To rise at dawn next day to take the road

For the journey I am telling you about. But, before I go further with this tale, And while I can, it seems reasonable That I should let you have a full description Of each of them, their sort and condition, At any rate as they appeared to me; Tell who they were, their status and profession, What they looked like, what kind of clothes they dressed in; And with a knight, then, I shall first begin. There was a Knight, * a reputable man, Who from the moment that he first began Campaigning, had cherished the profession Of arms; he also prized trustworthiness, Liberality, fame, and courteousness. In the king’s service he’d fought valiantly, And travelled far; no man as far as he In Christian and in heathen lands as well, And ever honoured for his ability. He was at Alexandria when it fell, Often he took the highest place at table Over the other foreign knights in Prussia; He’d raided in Lithuania and Russia, No Christian of his rank fought there more often. Also he’d been in Granada, at the siege Of Algeciras; forayed in Benmarin; At Ayas and Adalia he had been When they were taken; and with the great hosts Freebooting on the Mediterranean coasts; Fought fifteen mortal combats; thrice as champion In tournaments, he at Tramassene Fought for our faith, and each time killed his man. This worthy knight had also, for a time, Taken service in Palatia for the Bey, Against another heathen in Turkey; And almost beyond price was his prestige. Though eminent, he was prudent and sage, And in his bearing mild as any maid. He’d never been foul-spoken in his life To any kind of man; he was indeed The very pattern of a noble knight.

And on the other side a fancy dagger, Well-mounted, sharper than the point of spear, And on his breast a medal: St Christopher, The woodman’s patron saint, in polished silver. He bore a horn slung from a cord of green, And my guess is, he was a forester. There was also a nun, a Prioress, * Whose smile was unaffected and demure; Her greatest oath was just, ‘By St Eloi!’ * And she was known as Madame Eglantine. She sang the divine service prettily, And through the nose, becomingly intoned; And she spoke French well and elegantly As she’d been taught it at Stratford-at-Bow, * For French of Paris was to her unknown. Good table manners she had learnt as well: She never let a crumb from her mouth fall; She never soiled her fingers, dipping deep Into the sauce; when lifting to her lips Some morsel, she was careful not to spill So much as one small drop upon her breast. Her greatest pleasure was in etiquette. She used to wipe her upper lip so clean, No print of grease inside her cup was seen, Not the least speck, when she had drunk from it. Most daintily she’d reach for what she ate. No question, she possessed the greatest charm, Her demeanour was so pleasant, and so warm; Though at pains to ape the manners of the court, And be dignified, in order to be thought A person well deserving of esteem. But, speaking of her sensibility, She was so full of charity and pity That if she saw a mouse caught in a trap, And it was dead or bleeding, she would weep. She kept some little dogs, and these she fed On roast meat, or on milk and fine white bread. But how she’d weep if one of them were dead, Or if somebody took a stick to it! She was all sensitivity and tender heart.
